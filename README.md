# Grocery-List
Customize your grocery list by adding, marking off, or even sorting your wanted grocery items. 

When running this script a list of options will pop up. There will be 8 different options. To choose one you will need just to just enter the number of your desired option. 
Afterward, you'll get special directions unique to your choice that will either showcase the list or will require you to enter the name of an item. Make sure that when writing an item always start with an uppercase letter. 

Collaborations with Anabel S.
